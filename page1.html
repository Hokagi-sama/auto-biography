      	<p>My childhood was centered around <b>playing</b> with my friends, most of whom are actually my cousins on my mother's side. 
	Needless to say, I was a very playful kid back then. A bad day usually means a day in which I didn't get to play that 
	much outside our house. Although I had toys with me in our house and I did enjoy playing with them, my day would not be 
	complete without messing around with the other kids. We would be playing games like hide-and-seek and all sorts of entertaining 
	activities, which usually involves lots of running.</p>

	<p>As a result of moving around too much in my early years, I noticed that I possessed a certain level of <b><i>athleticism</i></b>. 
	I found out that I could <i>run faster</i>, <i>jump higher</i>, and <i>play longer</i> than the other kids. As a consequence, I fell inlove 
	with <b><u>sports</u></b>. The very first sport I played was basketball (although we used a soccer ball to play basketball). This would 
	then become one of my hobbies going forward. I would also learn to play other sports later, such as <b>badminton</b>, <b>table tennis</b>, 
	and <b>softball</b>.</p>
