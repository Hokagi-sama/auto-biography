		<h2>Academic Journey</h2>

        <p>I went to <b>Mindanao State University - Integrated Laboratory School (MSU-ILS)</b> for my elementary education. As I moved through 
	my elementary school years, I discovered a passion for learning. More specifically, I had a keen interest in the subject <i>Mathematics</i>. 
	After noticing that I would get higher marks on this subject than most of my classmates, I realized that I actually loved solving 
	mathematical problems. The challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction I get when I manage to solve them is just amazing. 
	This is all the more fulfilling when you realize that not many of your classmates can do what you can. So, this keen interest in Mathematics 
	stayed with me up until now.</p>

	<p>During my six-year long stay at MSU-ILS, I didn't get much involvement in any clubs or other extracurricular activities. I did sustain 
	my hobby of playing sports, but I didn't join any sports club or anything. Overall, my only aim at the time was to maintain my good grades 
	and be a good student. Because of that, I don't consider myself as an active member in leadership roles and community service. At the end 
	of my elementary journey, I managed to be an honor student along with winning other prestigious awards.</p>

	<p>After successfully passing the entrance examination, I enrolled at <b>Mindanao State University- Institute of Science Education (MSU-ISED)</b> 
	for my junior high school education. It is during this chapter of my life that I can say my potential for academic excellence has truly awakened. 
	As a prestigious institution known for its high quality training for Science and Mathematics, MSU-ISED is nothing short of an incredible journey for me. 
	My talent and skills in Mathematics was constantly being challenged and improved, and my passion for Science has also awakened. The challenge of 
	understanding the nature around me fascinated and fueled me to strive for excellence in the future.</p>

	<p>It was also during this time that I found interest in <b><i>quizzing</i></b>. During my four-year stay at MSU-ISED, I was selected two times to represent 
	the school in a prestigious quiz show organized by the <b>Integrated Quizzers Club (IQC)</b> of the <b>College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (CNSM)</b>, 
	during which I was able to win an award for my school. Because of that, I was able to win the <b>Quizzer of the Year Award</b> during the moving up 
	ceremony in my fourth year, in addition to completing my junior high school journey <b>With Honors</b> at this prestigious institution.</p>

	<p>As of now, I am currently enrolled at <b>Mindanao State University - Marawi Senior High School (MSU-MSHS)</b> as a Grade 12 STEM student. 
	Although some things may have changed with so much time passed, I am still actively pursuing my passions of quizzing and sports. I am a 
	member of the school's quizzers' club, the <b>MAVENS</b>, and we recently competed at the <b>University Quiz Show (UQC)</b> which our club won, thankfully. 
	On the other hand, my activities in sports has been unfortunately hindered by injuries. Just a year ago, I injured my knees. Then, I also 
	injured my shoulders just recently. However, this does not keep me from fighting for my passion in playing sports. In fact, I am preparing 
	to become a full-fledged varsity player of the <b>Mindanao State University Main Campus</b>, where I plan on going to college <i>InShaaAllah</i>.</p>
