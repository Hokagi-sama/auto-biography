        <p>My experiences during the last few years of my high school journey has been life-changer for me. These experiences have changed the way I 
	perceive life and have helped me to shape my character. Most importantly, I learned the value and significance of <b><i>personal growth</i></b>. I have learned 
	that working on yourself hard is more important than working hard on any other matter. This is because working for yourself will in turn help 
	those people around you, especially your family and friends. And no one can ask for more than having a happy life.</p>

	<p>Perhaps the most recent lesson I have learned is the importance of physical fitness and conditioning to a person, especially to an aspiring 
	athlete like me. After suffering many injuries in the past few months, I have decided to dedicate a significant amount of time in achieving my 
	goals on the area of physical conditioning. I have deemed it worthy to pursue an ideal body since it will not only help me become much healthier but 
	also it will help me become a proper athlete in the future.</p>

	<p>As for my future career, I am currently deciding on pursuing a <b>potential career path between <i>engineering</i> and <i>accountancy</i></b>. 
	These two fields are the most practical choices for me right now. Regardless of which path I decide to take, I am confident that it 
	will be a journey full of lessons and noteworthy experiences. And I know that my loved ones are going to be there to support me in every step 
	of the way, just as I am in every step of their journey. </p>

	<p>I am grateful for the support of my family, teachers, and friends who have helped shape me into the person I am today. With their encouragement, 
	along with my ambition and determination, I am eager to embark on the next phase of my life's journey.</p>
